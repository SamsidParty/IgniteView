    A Lightweight framework for building cross-platform web apps with .NET

# Motivation 🧁
Technology used to build web-based apps already exist, like [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/), however there are only a handful that have strong integration with C#.
IgniteView fills this gap by providing a robust toolchain and runtime to get a web app up and running using C#.

# Features 🔥
- Automatic setup and integration with [Vite](https://vite.dev/), just hit run in VS and you're good to go
- Integrates with the native webview of the platform (WebView2, WebKit, or WebKitGTK)
- Easy C# API with a command bridge for seamless interop
- Window transparency with acrylic/mica, for a native-looking window

# Documentation 📖
